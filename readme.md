## **Introduction**

This library is for the fast implementation of model predictive control (MPC) policies in Python. The code is optimized for fast implementation and testing of nonlinear objective functions and was developed as a part of an undergraduate thesis project at the Ohio State University (linked below).

The library is currently being optimized for use in **MicroPython** and thus has been modified so that it does not require a *numpy* dependency - removing the need to install third-party libraries on the microcontroller of interest. The following sections of the *readme* will discuss the MPC policy structure and show demonstrations when applicable.
